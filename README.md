# Mangrove-Project
In order to promote mangrove growth, a matrix model of its regeneration after disturbances was obtained from a research paper written by
Peter J. Clarke entitled "The population dynamics of the mangrove Avicennia marina; demographic synthesis and predictive modeling." To 
accomplish this, concepts from linear algebra were applied, using Python to perform the computational legwork.
