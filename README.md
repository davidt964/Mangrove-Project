# Mangrove-Project
In order to promote mangrove growth, a matrix model of its regeneration after disturbances was obtained from a research paper written by
Peter J. Clarke entitled "The population dynamics of the mangrove Avicennia marina; demographic synthesis and predictive modeling." To 
accomplish this, concepts from linear algebra were applied, using Python to perform the computational legwork.

# Project Report
A more comprehensive analysis of the findings can be found on my LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidt964/). It includes intepretation
of the data and potential applications.
